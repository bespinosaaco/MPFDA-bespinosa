## How to use the weekly tracker

For a cleaner user experience use the `bespinosa_acosta_cleared.ipynb`.  
To see all the workings and instructions use the `bespinosa_acosta.ipynb`.

The usage is simple. Run the cell titled functions and imports to define all the functions of the weekly tracker. Then run the **Main Logic (Part 6)** cell which will initialize the program.

Decide wether to initiate a new weekly tracker or continue with the one on the saved Jupyter running instance.

Then follow the prompt to add, mark as complete, remove or print task and habits.

Here is the option menu for the program.
